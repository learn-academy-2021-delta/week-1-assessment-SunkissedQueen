# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is a command or declaration on the terminal to inform the terminal to grab or create a file in the Github repository, desktop folder, or another designated folder or drive. Github is a wonderful storage center for files. It is the space that the "git" command collects and places files. Github allows several people to work on a project and allows those people to create temporary folders to test out their coding before placing into the main application of the project.

  Researched answer:
  In web development, two major elements are the software and a hosting site to create the project. Git is that software located locally on a computer. It is a tool used on a command line, such as terminal, which allows an organization control different versions of a project and share that code within smaller teams as well as back to the main source code. GitHub located on the web and is a service concerned with the GUI (graphic user interface). It is a central point to host the source code and allow the various versions of the project to be stored in a main folder called a repository.


2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: A Boolean value can be produced while using the following evaluations:
  a) true/false, yes or no, either/or,
  b) mathematical evaluations > < >= <=
  c) relative == or absolute equality===
  d) != bang operator
  e) && and   || or

  Researched answer: Coding will result in a value displayed on the GUI. Boolean values are expressed as true or false. The following evaluations will produce a Boolean value:
  a) equality operators (== loose, === strict)
  b) relational operators (>, <, >=, <=)
  c) logical operators (&& and, || or, ! not)


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a numerical representation of a location of a character. An index is zeroed; meaning that when counting a character or string, the first character is at location 0, the next is 1, etc. A value can be a number, a string, an equation; it is whatever you assign to a variable. It can also be the results of an equation or the output of a function.

  Researched answer: Values also known as data delivered in various forms---numbers, strings, or objects. Variables are the containers that store this data that will be provided after a user input. Because values are sequence based, any character within that sequence can be rendered by using an index number associated with its location within that given sequence. Indexes are zero-based, which means that the first character has a index of 0. The next index is 1, and each character following will continue ascending the numerical sequence. Spaces within a value are counted as a character. Whole words in arrays are counted as a single index; ie. ["January", "February", "March"] will have a zero index at the value "January".


4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: Key words or common jargon used in coding; certain words in camelCase (if properly arranged in a function or with a property) will acts an activator for a series of functions. So in stead of having to write 20 lines of coding, I can write a word that will activate that string of code.

  Researched answer:
  In the art of development, we often perform many common actions. Many shortcuts or pre-made functions were created to allow developers to use properties that are unique to certain datatypes. These shortcuts are called built-in methods, and they are initiated through designated method names when combined with appropriate datatypes within parenthesis.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming consists of two people---a driver and a navigator. The driver will be typing the code. Navigator is the person who will review the code for errors and talk about the purpose of each code. Only one person should be typing so errors can be caught while the driver is typing. The driver should give the navigator an opportunity to speak about the direction to take on the coding. Each member should be mindful of allowing each other to test ideas. Coding is a learning tool. So many ways to reach the solution.

  Researched answer:
  Pair programming allows two colleagues to collaborate on one coding project with the important tool called communication. Each team member is afforded an opportunity to use proper coding vocabulary to find solutions to assigned projects. Each colleague will rotate roles as a driver typing and maintaining the editor or as a navigator advising on the direction for the code and reviewing errors in the code. There are many things that can help a team be effective in pair programming. Setting goals on the task and when to rotate roles are just a few suggestions. Each member should speak up if the code is not understandable or if they feel that their ideas are not tested. Regardless of experience level, each member can benefit if they give each other space to learn and train.  


6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Rotating the pair programming partners. Getting a chance to see so many personalties show us how to either speak up, silence our overzealousness to find an answer, be patient, see a different perspective. So much growth occurs in sharing ideas and respecting ideas. There is magic in mistakes.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: running a portion of a code until either a condition is met or a time out is exceeded

2. Higher Order Functions: ability to allow a function to be accepted as a parameter or be returned as a result

3. Jest: a space to test javascript code

4. Objects: a variable container with many values

5. Classes: functions used to create objects
